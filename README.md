# Recruit Rockfish Abundance at Santa Cruz Island Through "The Blob"

This repository contains the final project materials for EDS 222 - *Statistics for Environmental Data Science*.

## About
This project aims apply a Hurdle Model to rockfish recruitment data in the Channel Islands. 


## Hypotheses

H0: An increase in SST has no effect on rockfish recruitment

Ha: A increase in SST increases rockfish recruitment

## Statistical Notation
$$FishPresence ~ binomial(1, p)$$ 
$$logit(p) = B0 + B1 * SST$$



$$Fishcount ~ NegativeBinomial(\mu, \theta)$$ 
$$log(\mu) = B2 + B3 * SST$$
